The primary objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving two types of vaccines: the XYZ vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. This is a multilabel classification problem where we predict two probabilities for each respondent: one for the XYZ vaccine and one for the seasonal flu vaccine. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts these probabilities based on a variety of demographic, behavioral, and opinion-related features.
